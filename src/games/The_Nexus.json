These allow you to look at and pick up items, walk around, talk to characters and more. \n\nIMPORTANT: The game supports many unlisted natural language commands (like \"play piano\" or \"drink water\"). Feel free to experiment and see what works (sometimes, you will have to!) However, the following list of basic commands includes most of what you need to complete the game. \n\n!!!!SAY \"HELP\" TO SEE THESE COMMANDS AGAIN!!!!\n\n***INTERACTIONS WITH ROOMS, OBJECTS, AND CHARACTERS***\n\n\"Look around\" \nTells you what's in the current room.\n\n\"Inventory\"\nTells you what objects you are currently carrying.\n\n\"Look at _____\" \n\n\"Take/Pick up _____\"\n\n\"Use _____\"\n\n\"Use _____ with _____ \" \nCombines objects together.\n\n\"Open _____\" and \"Close _____\"\n\n\"Push _____\" and \"Pull _____\"\n\n***CONVERSATIONS***\n\n\"Talk to _____\"\n\n\"List topics\" \nAfter you've started a conversation with someone, view what topics are available to discuss. (If you get the response \"You don't see that there\" make sure you're actually in a converation. \"Talk to\" the character.)\n\n\"Ask about _____\" \nAfter you've started a conversation, ask about specific topics available for that character.\n\n\"Goodbye\" \nEnds a conversation you're having with a character. \n\n***BASIC NAVIGATION***\n\n\"Go North/South/West/East/Up/Down\"\nNavigate the game with these basic cardinal directions.\n\n\"List exits\" \nTells you what exits are available in the current room/scene.\n\n***FAST TRAVEL***\n \nAfter you've already visited a room, you can fast travel back at any point by simply saying: \n\"Go to _____\" – (e.g. \"Go to the Living Room\")\n\n!!!!SAY \"HELP\" TO SEE THESE COMMANDS AGAIN!!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPART I: THE NEXUS\n\nYour eyes blink open as the world around you comes into focus. You are in a small sparsely decorated bedroom with an antique style reminiscent of a time you can't quite place. \n\nYou don't know how you got here... The last thing you remember was sipping a cup of coffee in that old diner on the corner of Jackson Square. The flavor of its chicory spice still hangs on your tongue, yet it seems like it all happened a hundred years ago. \n\nThere was a girl, she was in trouble... You search your memory for more detail, but the strain hurts your head. It is an odd sensation -- it's not that you can't remember, but rather your brain just can't be bothered to do it right now. \n\nYou snap out of your reverie and notice the details of the room.",

Figure maybe it can help with our memory if we start keeping a little voice diary. So, you know, don’t forget to keep up with, okay? Also, don’t tell father about this. He doesn’t like me messing with temporal artifacts, so it’s our little secret. He’s gone again today. He's been gone for awhile this time. Maybe in Europe again. Hope he comes back soon, the house is really starting to fall apart. In his absence, I’ve taken to walking the grounds. Yesterday I tried to solve the hedge maze, but nothing made any sense to me. I know there’s some trick to it, but it’s hard to run an empirical study when you can barely even remember what you had breakfast. Tonight I think I’ll go up the lighthouse and watch the stars flickering over the edge of the world. I like looking at them – it’s peaceful. It almost feels like I’m somewhere else. \"\n",

These allow you to look at and pick up items, walk around, talk to characters and more. \n\nIMPORTANT: The game supports many unlisted natural language commands (like \"play piano\" or \"drink water\"). Feel free to experiment and see what works (sometimes, you will have to!) However, the following list of basic commands includes most of what you need to complete the game. \n\n!!!!SAY \"HELP\" TO SEE THESE COMMANDS AGAIN!!!!\n\n***INTERACTIONS WITH ROOMS, OBJECTS, AND CHARACTERS***\n\n\"Look around\" \nTells you what's in the current room.\n\n\"Inventory\"\nTells you what objects you are currently carrying.\n\n\"Look at _____\" \n\n\"Take/Pick up _____\"\n\n\"Use _____\"\n\n\"Use _____ with _____ \" \nCombines objects together.\n\n\"Open _____\" and \"Close _____\"\n\n\"Push _____\" and \"Pull _____\"\n\n***CONVERSATIONS***\n\n\"Talk to _____\"\n\n\"List topics\" \nAfter you've started a conversation with someone, view what topics are available to discuss. (If you get the response \"You don't see that there\" make sure you're actually in a converation. \"Talk to\" the character.)\n\n\"Ask about _____\" \nAfter you've started a conversation, ask about specific topics available for that character.\n\n\"Goodbye\" \nEnds conversation you're having with a character. \n\n***BASIC NAVIGATION***\n\n\"Go North/South/West/East/Up/Down\"\nNavigate the game with these basic cardinal directions.\n\n\"List exits\" \nTells you what exits are available in the current room/scene.\n\n***FAST TRAVEL***\n \nAfter you've already visited a room, you can fast travel back at any point by simply saying: \n\"Go to _____\" – (e.g. \"Go to the Living Room\")\n\n!!!!SAY \"HELP\" TO SEE THESE COMMANDS AGAIN!!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
